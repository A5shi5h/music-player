# music-player
This is music player that i built from scratch .

Tech Stack that I used are :
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

What I learned from this project:
1. I learned about DOM Manipulation.
2. I learned about Audio function.
3. Build logic about how play , pause , forward , backward functionality work in a music player
4. I also learned about targetting an heml element solely usin javascript and changing image according to th clicked song.

Where did I face problem
1. I faced problem while building logic for forward and backward button as I wanted the song to continue playing and not pause when new song was played.


Big thanks to Sheriyan Coding School for the guidance......
